## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the gerontocracy. I would potentially explore the following questions:
- How does the average age of civil servant in the executive, legislative, and judicial branch of the United States government compare?
- How does the average age of civil servant compare to newly elected / incumbent? 
- (Correlative relationship) How do the approval ratings of civil servants compare with ages of civil servants over time?
