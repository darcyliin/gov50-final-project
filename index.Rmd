## Introduction
Does increasing campaign ads increase votes? In this study, I plan to examine the extent to which campaign ads can predict the 2016 election outcome. I will do so by comparing the proportion of campaign ads that belong to a politician and the proportion of the vote that they received in the 2016 presidential election for that district. 

I hypothesize that, in general, an increase in campaign ads will be a strong predictor for how well a candidate does in that area.

This question is important because politicians invest a lot of money into their campaign ads in order to increase their voter share. According to NPR, in 2016, presidential candidates were predicted to spend $4.4 billion (source: https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/19/432759311/2016-campaign-tv-ad-spending). However, do these campaign ads actually affect their election results? 

## Data Section
My sample is composed of two sources. 

The explanatory variable is proportion of Hillary Clinton campaign ads in a region. The outcome variable is the proportion of the vote that Hillary Clinton won. The explanatory variable was captured by the Political TV Ad Archive. It is comprised of campaign ads from the primary period through the 2016 election in regions across the United States. I sorted the data set to only include pro-presidential campaign ads. 

The dependent variable is the final election votes from the regions that the ad campaigns ran in. The final election votes were compiled from various Green Pages for the relevant districts. 

If I observe a strong correlation between campaign ads and election results, I will have support for my hypothesis. 

My study is cross-sectionalâ€”observing the effect of voting after exposing to TV ads. It is a census -- taking all the campaign ads from a district and all the votes from that district into consideration.

```

RESULT SUMMARY: 
In the scatterplot, we can see that as Hillary Clinton's proportion of campaign ads increased, her share of the vote actually decreased. According to the line of best fit model, the intercept is 79.88. That means that when Clinton ads make up 0% of the campaign ads, she has 77.88% of the vote for that district. The slope is -0.405. That is, for every increase in 1 percentage point of the campaign ads that Clinton's ads make up, her share of the vote decreases by 0.405 percentage points. 

Based on this study, we find that increasing candidate's ads make up of campaign ads are actually correlated with a decrease in share of election votes. 

The survey is not causal. It was an observational study, not a randomized experimental design. Additionally, share of campaign ads and election votes might be related. That is, a district with negative pre-existing notions of Hillary Clinton may be targeted with a greater percentage of ads in order to improve that perception. 

It is also not statistically significant. The p-value for the slope is 0.102. As this p-value is greater than the standard alpha value of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that increasing percentage of campaign ads increase percentage of election votes. 

## Conclusion

My original hypothesis that increasing share of election ads would increase share of election votes was incorrect. I do not find support for my hypothesis. 

LIMITATIONS / IMPROVEMENT:
One limitation of this study is that the 2016 presidential election was already extremely contentious. As such, it may not be the best study for the efficacy of campaign ads. A better study subject might be an election that is not as polarized/sensationalized and a lower-scale one (such as gubernatorial or congressional, although these seats can also be just as drama-ridden as presidential). 

Another limitation of this study was that we solely looked at the election results for the impact. A better study would have assessed continuously throughout the campaign how people's perceptions of the election may have changed with changes in share of campaign ads.
